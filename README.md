### Releasing a new version

Prerequisites:
- You must have git configured with your GPG credentials (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work).
- You must have lein configured with your Clojars credentials (instructions: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md#gpg).
- You must be a member of the b-social group on Clojars.

You should then be able to run:
```
lein release
```

This will handle changing the versions everywhere, and adding the version tags.
It will deploy the latest to Clojars and push all the changes to GitHub.
